The csv file is about wine data, contains various aspects of red and white wine with ratings.

I cleaned and modified this dataset for investigations below:

QUESTIONS\
1 Is a certain type of wine (red or white) associated with higher quality?\
2 What level of acidity (pH value) receives the highest average rating?\
3 Do wines with higher alcoholic content receive better ratings?\
4 Do sweeter wines receive better ratings?
