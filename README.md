Wine database analysis

Dataset is available at UCL
https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Wine+Quality

I cleaned, modified this dataset for investigations below:

QUESTIONS
1 Is a certain type of wine (red or white) associated with higher quality?
2 What level of acidity (pH value) receives the highest average rating?
3 What level of alcohol receives the highest average rating?
4 What level of residual sugar receives the highest average rating?
